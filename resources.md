# Course Textbook
The course uses the textbook: Computer Networks: A Systems Approach (5th Edition) by Larry Peterson and Bruce Davie. The e-book version of this textbook is available at the [Cornell library](https://www.library.cornell.edu/).


# Practice Exams and Review Sessions
Before every exam (Prelim 1, Prelim 2 and final), we will hold review sessions where the TAs will review the course content and discuss any questions you might have. We will also release practice problems before the exams.
